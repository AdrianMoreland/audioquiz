      "Can be avoided by using a high-pass filter"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Aliasing happens when a high-frequency component is mistaken for a lower frequency because the sampling rate is too low. It appears as a 'ghost' lower frequency in the recording."

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The Fourier transform is a mathematical tool used in Fourier analysis. It decomposes a complex signal (time domain) into its constituent sine and cosine waves of various frequencies (frequency domain). This allows us to analyze the frequency content of a signal and understand how different frequencies contribute to the overall sound."

      "To determine the minimum sampling rate required to accurately represent a signal"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is a fundamental principle in digital signal processing. It states that to perfectly reconstruct a continuous-time signal from its digital samples, the sampling rate (number of samples per second) must be at least twice the highest frequency component present in the original analog signal. This ensures that enough information is captured to avoid aliasing (distortion caused by under-sampling)."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem applies specifically to digital recording because it deals with the conversion of a continuous analog signal into discrete digital samples. While analog recordings themselves don't have a sampling rate, the process of converting them to a digital format (e.g., CD) requires adhering to the Nyquist principle to avoid aliasing in the final digital representation."
